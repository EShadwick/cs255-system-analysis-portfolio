# CS 255 – System Analysis and Design Portfolio

## DriverPass Project Overview
The DriverPass project was developed for a client named DriverPass, a company that provides driver education services. The client required a web-based system that would allow students to register for driving packages, schedule driving lessons, complete practice exams, and track their progress. The system also needed to support administrative users who manage accounts, schedules, and reporting, as well as integrate with DMV systems to ensure current and accurate testing information.

## What I Did Well
One area where I performed particularly well was gathering and organizing business requirements into a clear and structured document. I effectively translated customer needs into functional and non-functional requirements that could guide system development. Additionally, I aligned the system design closely with these requirements using UML diagrams and clear documentation to illustrate system structure and behavior.

## Areas for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, I would enhance the level of technical detail in the system design document. While the overall architecture was well defined, I would add more detailed sequence diagrams and expand explanations of data flow to further clarify interactions between system components.

## Interpreting User Needs
User needs were interpreted by analyzing the project scenario and identifying the goals of each user role, including students, administrators, and instructors. These needs were implemented through features such as role-based access control, scheduling functionality, progress tracking, and reporting tools. Considering user needs is critical to system design because it ensures usability, improves user satisfaction, and increases the likelihood that the system will be successfully adopted.

## Software Design Approach
My approach to designing software begins with understanding the problem domain and identifying stakeholders and user roles. I then gather requirements, develop use cases, and create UML diagrams to visualize system behavior and structure. In future projects, I will continue using these techniques along with iterative refinement and user feedback to ensure that system designs align with business objectives and real-world user needs.
